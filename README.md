# This is the corresponding repo for the ACM TechTalk: Ethical and Responsible Large Language Models: Challenges and Best Practices


### This repos covers: 
* Analyzing the tokens, layers and matrices of LLMs with captum.ai. Note that the two notebooks are taken from: https://captum.ai/tutorials/, interpreting BERT. 
* Using [LIME](https://lime-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for explaining local predictions.
* How to use Weights & Biases to create tables and log the models predictions.
* Applying postprocessing techniques with [fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) and [AIF360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360)
